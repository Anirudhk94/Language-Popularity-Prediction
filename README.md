# Language-Popularity-Prediction

With new programming technologies and frameworks being developed every year, the toughest part of learning programming is deciding where to begin, especially, if you are new to the field of software development. There are hundreds of programming languages in widespread use, each with its own complexities and idiosyncrasies. In this project, an attempt is made to build a  dashboard with interactive data visualizations that represents coding languages popularity for the years 2017-18 using the Stack Overflow's developer survey results. Additionally, by making use of time series analysis of the above data, a prediction will be made to quantify the popularity of programming languages for 2019. This dashboard will help its users in discovering which programming languages will be most suitable for their interests and career goals.
